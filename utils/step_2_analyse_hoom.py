# From this result we understand what is happening:
# The predicates we checked earlier:
# http://purl.org/oban/association_has_object (115087 occurrences)
# http://purl.org/oban/association_has_subject (115087 occurrences)
# do indeed exist and are key in onthology dataset, but not as RDF instances ‚Äî rather as elements of OWL restrictions (owl:onProperty).
# This means that the 'disease ‚Üí symptom' relationships are modeled using OWL restrictions with properties from the OBAN namespace, e.g.:
#
# <Class rdf:about="Disease_XYZ">
#   <equivalentClass>
#     <Class>
#       <intersectionOf rdf:parseType="Collection">
#         <Class rdf:about="&obo;Disease"/>
#         <Restriction>
#           <onProperty rdf:resource="http://purl.org/oban/association_has_subject"/>
#           <someValuesFrom rdf:resource="&ordo;Disease_XYZ"/>
#         </Restriction>
#         <Restriction>
#           <onProperty rdf:resource="http://purl.org/oban/association_has_object"/>
#           <someValuesFrom rdf:resource="&hpo;Symptom_ABC"/>
#         </Restriction>
#       </intersectionOf>
#     </Class>
#   </equivalentClass>
# </Class>
#
# So onthology data looks like this (disease and symptom are connected via OWL restrictions using association_has_subject and association_has_object).

# What does this imply?
#
# The predicates association_has_subject and association_has_object are missing.
# onthology analysis revealed that these predicates do not appear in the RDF/XML.
# This means that previous assumptions (which were based on popular patterns from the OBAN model) are not valid for this file.
# Other important predicates are present:
# The most frequent predicates (besides standard RDF/OWL ones) are:
# owl:equivalentClass
# owl:intersectionOf
# owl:someValuesFrom
# owl:hasValue
# These predicates suggest that the relationships between diseases and symptoms are modeled not by simple triples,
# but through equivalent class definitions (owl:equivalentClass) composed of property restrictions (owl:intersectionOf + owl:onProperty + owl:someValuesFrom).
# üîç What does this mean in practice (ontology structure)?
#
# onthology data likely looks something like this (OWL schema):
# :DiseaseXYZ owl:equivalentClass [
#     owl:intersectionOf (
#         :Disease
#         [ owl:onProperty :hasSymptom ;
#           owl:someValuesFrom :SymptomABC ]
#         [ owl:onProperty :hasSymptom ;
#           owl:someValuesFrom :SymptomDEF ]
#     )
# ].
# Instead of having a simple triple like:
# :DiseaseXYZ :hasSymptom :SymptomABC .
# you have equivalent class definitions that need to be unpacked.
